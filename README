                        LIXA (LIbre XA)

LIXA is a software libre implementation of a transaction manager XA compliant.

LIBXML2 dependency:
This software needs libxml2 to be compiled and executed.
If your libxml2 headers are not in standard include directory, use the
command
	export CPPFLAGS=-I/path/to/libxml2
before configure.
Example: my libxml2 header files are rooted at /usr/include/libxml2
	export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/libxml2
	./configure
	make

DEBUG messages:
Enabling debug messages (for developers only):
	./configure --enable-debug
	make

Debug build is generally not suggested for production environments.
You must set LIXA_TRACE_MASK environment variable according to values 
described in file src/common/lixa_trace.h to see debug output messages
	export LIXA_TRACE_MASK="0xffff"
to enable all trace messages (very verbose)
