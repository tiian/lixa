*********
ABSTRACT:

LIXA, acronym of LIbre XA, is an open source and free software Transaction
Manager that implements:
- XTA, XA Transaction API, an interface specifically designed to supply
  TXaaS (Transaction as a Service) features in a FaaS (Function as a Service)
  ecosystem.
- the distributed transaction processing "XA specification" and
  the "TX (transaction demarcation) specification" according to the
  X/Open CAE Specification
LIXA is a Transaction Manager but it's not a Transaction Monitor: this is the
distinguishing feature of the project: it enables every application container,
like a web server or a shell, to become an XA compliant application server.
The client/server architecture of LIXA allows many application containers to
point a single LIXA state server: this is ideal where horizontal scalability is
a must and many identical application containers must refer to the same
transactional environment.

DOCUMENTATION:
Documentation is available in these places:
- local directory doc/manuals/index.html after tarball extraction
- http://www.tiian.org/lixa/manuals/html/index.html
- http://www.tiian.org/lixa/manuals/xta/C/index.html
- http://www.tiian.org/lixa/manuals/xta/CPP/index.html
- http://www.tiian.org/lixa/manuals/xta/Java/index.html

Some important things you should check in the documentation before going on:
1. check LIXA dependency looking at "Installation/System requirements"
2. understand LIXA installation procedure describe at "Installation/Configure,
   build and install"
3. if you are interested in the test procedure (after build), take a look to
   "Installation/Checking"
4. how to understand what's happening inside LIXA code is explained in
   "In Depth/Tracing"
5. examples are described in chapter "Development"

Doxygen source code documentation: how to extract from LIXA source code the
documentation of files, structs and functions (you must install Doxygen
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ before you can use it).
Please update doxygen.conf.in and change /var/www/lixa to a suitable 
destination in your system.
Use "configure" (see above) to produce "doxygen.conf" file.
If you installed Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/), configure should detect
it and would produce data and headers dependencies too.
