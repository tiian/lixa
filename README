                        LIXA (LIbre XA)

LIXA is a software libre implementation of a transaction manager XA compliant.

LIBXML2 dependency:
This software needs libxml2 and glib2 to be compiled and executed.
Just for the sake of "simplicity" LIXA uses pkg-config tool to retrieve
libxml2 and glib2 configuration.
If your libxml2 and/or glib2 are not configured with pkg-config, you could try
to export standard Automake shell variables to supply include and library
paths.

This is an example if the libxml2 headers are not in standard include 
directory and it's not pkg-config configured: use this command
	export CPPFLAGS=-I/path/to/libxml2
before configure.
Example: my libxml2 header files are rooted at /usr/include/libxml2
	export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/libxml2
	./configure
	make

You must set LIXA_TRACE_MASK environment variable according to values 
described in file src/common/lixa_trace.h to see debug output messages
	export LIXA_TRACE_MASK="0xffff"
to enable all trace messages (very verbose)

If you really want to disable trace messages at source code level, use
	./configure --disable-trace
this option is not suggested until the software will be very stable and your
operating environment too :-)

If you want to insert extra debug code at source code level, use
	./configure --enable-debug

On my Ubuntu systems, to build Oracle XE cdemo81 sample, I use something like 
this:
	./configure --with-oracle=/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server
	make

but to execute the sample too, the path is longer:
	./configure --with-oracle=/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server --prefix=/tmp/lixa
	make
	make install
	sudo su - oracle
	cd /tmp/lixa/bin
	./lixa_oracle_sample [delete]
because the application must be executed by "oracle" user or you have to deal
with Oracle's own permission (this is not a source for Oracle info
unfortunately, so only very basic set-up is explained)

Doxygen documentation.
There is a minimal configuration for Doxygen inside LIXA.
Please update doxygen.conf.in and change /var/www/lixa to a suitable 
destination in your system.
Use "configure" (see above) to produce "doxygen.conf" file.
Strike:
doxygen doxygen.conf 
to publish the project code auto-documentation.
Have fun!
