	LIXA, LIbre XA, a free and open source XA transaction manager

LIXA (LIbre XA) is an open source and free Transaction Manager implementing the
distributed transaction processing "XA specification" and "TX (transaction
demarcation) specification" according to the X/Open CAE Specification.
LIXA is a Transaction Manager but it's not a Transaction Monitor: this is the
distinguishing feature of the project: it enables every application container,
like a web server or a shell, to become an XA compliant application server.
The client/server architecture of LIXA allows many application container to
point a single LIXA server: this is ideal where horizontal scalability is a
must and many identical application containers must refer to a single
transactional environment.

Documentation is available in these places:
- local directory doc/manuals/index.html after tarball extraction
- http://lixa.sourceforge.net/manuals/index.html

Some important things you should check in the documentation before going on:
1. check LIXA dependency looking at "Installation/System requirements"
2. understand LIXA installation procedure describe at "Installation/Configure,
   build and install"
3. if you are interested in the test procedure (after build), take a look to
   "Installation/Checking"
4. how to understand what's happening inside LIXA code is explained in
   "In Depth/Tracing"
5. examples are described in chapter "Development"

Doxygen source code documentation: how to extract from LIXA source code the
documentation of files, structs and functions (you must install Doxygen
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ before you can use it).
Please update doxygen.conf.in and change /var/www/lixa to a suitable 
destination in your system.
Use "configure" (see above) to produce "doxygen.conf" file.
If you installed Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/), configure should detect
it and would produce data and headers dependencies too.
