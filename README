                        LIXA (LIbre XA)

LIXA is a software libre implementation of a transaction manager XA compliant.

LIBXML2 dependency:
This software needs libxml2 to be compiled and executed.
If your libxml2 headers are not in standard include directory, use the
command
	export CPPFLAGS=-I/path/to/libxml2
before configure.
Example: my libxml2 header files are rooted at /usr/include/libxml2
	export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/libxml2
	./configure
	make

You must set LIXA_TRACE_MASK environment variable according to values 
described in file src/common/lixa_trace.h to see debug output messages
	export LIXA_TRACE_MASK="0xffff"
to enable all trace messages (very verbose)

If you really want to disable trace messages at source code level, use
	./configure --disable-trace
this option is not suggested until the software will be very stable and your
operating environment too :-)

If you want to insert extra debug code at source code level, use
	./configure --enable-debug

On my Ubuntu systems, to build Oracle XE cdemo81 sample, I use something like 
this:
	export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/libxml2
	./configure --with-oracle=/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server
	make

but to execute the sample too, the path is longer:
	export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/include/libxml2
	./configure --with-oracle=/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server --prefix=/tmp/lixa
	make
	make install
	sudo su - oracle
	cd /tmp/lixa/bin
	./cdemo81
because the application must be executed by "oracle" user or you have to deal
with Oracle's own permission (this is not a source for Oracle info
unfortunately, so only very basic set-up is explained)
