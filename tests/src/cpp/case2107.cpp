/*
 * This program is an example implementation of the
 * "Multiple Applications, Concurrent Branches/Pseudo Synchronous" Pattern
 * as documented in LIXA manual:
 * http://www.tiian.org/lixa/manuals/html/index.html
 *
 * This program accepts exactly four parameters on the command line:
 * first parameter:  "commit", boolean value (if FALSE, "rollback")
 * second parameter: "insert", boolean value (if FALSE, "delete")
 * third parameter:  "sup2sub_filename", a string with the name of the FIFO
 *                   (named pipe) that must be used for superior->subordinate
 *                   communication
 * fourth parameter: "sub2sup_filename", a string with the name of the FIFO
 *                   (named pipe) that must be used for subordinate->superior
 *                   communication
 *
 * Programming Style note:
 * the purpose of this small program is not to explain C++ development
 * techniques or good style, but simply to show XTA for C++ using the easiest
 * approach.
 * "xta" namespace is explicitly put in every statement (see "xta::") but it
 * can be avoided with "using namespace xta;"
