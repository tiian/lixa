AT_BANNER([TX: 3.6 Transaction Timeout])

AT_SETUP([TX/3.6/0.0])
# To control the amount of resource spent executing a transaction, an AP may 
# use tx_set_transaction_timeout ( ) to set the transaction_timeout value.
# This value specifies the time period (in seconds) in which the transaction
# must complete before it becomes susceptible to transaction timeout. A value
# of 0 means that the timeout feature is disabled. The initial setting for
# each AP is 0.
# An AP may call tx_set_transaction_timeout ( ) at any time, but the call
# affects only transactions the AP begins subsequently. If an AP calls
# tx_set_transaction_timeout ( ) in transaction mode, the new timeout value
# does not affect the current transaction.
# The timeout interval begins and is reset whenever the AP calls tx_begin( ).
# It is also reset by tx_commit( ) or tx_rollback ( ) in the chained mode when
# these functions start a new transaction. If the AP does not call either
# tx_commit( ) or tx_rollback ( ) before the interval expires, the TM
# declares a timeout whenever it is possible to do so (under certain
# circumstances the TM may not be able to interrupt an operation in progress).
# A transaction for which the TM has declared a timeout is rolled back.
# Transaction state information returned by tx_info ( ) indicates that a
# transaction has timed out and has been marked rollback-only. To complete
# such a transaction, the AP should call tx_rollback ( ). If an AP issues a
# tx_commit( ) for a transaction that has been marked rollback only, the TM
# rolls back the transaction.
