# Al case tests check these statements:

# If info is null, no TXINFO structure is returned.
#
# If the caller is in transaction mode, 1 is returned. If the caller is not in
# transaction mode, 0 is returned.
#
# If tx_info ( ) is called in transaction mode, xid is populated with a
# current transaction branch identifier and transaction_state contains the
# state of the current transaction. If the caller is not in transaction mode,
# xid is populated with the null XID

# The transaction committed successfully; however, a new transaction could not
