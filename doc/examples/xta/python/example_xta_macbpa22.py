# "Single Application" Pattern
# as documented in LIXA manual:
# http://www.tiian.org/lixa/manuals/html/index.html

# This program accepts exactly two parameters on the command line:
# first parameter:  "commit", boolean value (if FALSE, "rollback")
# second parameter: "insert", boolean value (if FALSE, "delete")
#
# Programming Style note:
# the purpose of this small program is not to explain Python development
# techniques or good style, but simply to show XTA for Python using the easiest
# approach.
