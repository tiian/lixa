20091212 - 0.3.4 bug # 2912287 fix

20091210 - 0.3.3 bug # 2907554 fix

20091208 - 0.3.2 bug # 2909089 fix

20091202 - 0.3.0 release; all "tx_" functions are available, many are dummies

20090330 - 0.1.0 first very early release, the daemon compiles and run, but is
           useless

TODO:
2009032901
liblixacommon is compiled with POSIX thread enabled; when a non POSIX
thread enable version of "client" will be released, liblixacommon must be
double compiled (single and multithread)

2009040101
lixad command line should be able to specify a custom config file instead of
default system configuration file; server_config() is already enabled

2009040701
lixad_conf.xml should be validated against a DTD or a schema to detect
malformed configuration files

2009040702
lixad should be able to run as a console process, not only as a daemon, for
debug purpouses. It's sufficient to skip "daemonize()" function and it seems
all works in console environment

2009051201
client status collection index could use a double array instead of allocating
and freeing the array every time insert/delete operation is asked

2009051401
a client that performs a lot of tx_open/tx_close can saturate all the available
TCP/IP connection and "connect" functions fail.
SO_LINGER could be a "solution", but this may generate different issues as
W. Richard Stevens explained in "UNIX network programming".

2009081601
conditional compilation should allow to compile/not compile Oracle related
stuff; unfortunately I was not able to set AM_CONDITIONAL properly to address
the result. It must be reworked later.
*** SOLVED *** 20090925: now conditional compilation works fine for Oracle
related stuff.

2009101001
libxml2 include and library path should be specified using configure standards
and not with an exported shell variable (include files and library can be at
different rooted path, so 3 configure options must be implemented):
--with-libxml2=[DIR]
--with-libxml2-include=[DIR]
--with-libxml2-lib=[DIR]
*** SOLVED *** 20091030: now pkg-config is used instead of command line options

2009111301
if a server thread receives an error, some recovery action must happen
(nowaday the listener is not informed and all the server hang when all the
threads exited)
