LOG:
20090330 - 0.1.0 first very early release, the daemon compiles and run, but is
           useless

TODO:
2009032901
liblixacommon is compiled with POSIX thread enabled; when a non POSIX
thread enable version of "client" will be released, liblixacommon must be
double compiled (single and multithread)
