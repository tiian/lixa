LOG:
	   1.9.0 Added new state engine for the state server (lixad)
		 Set a new environment variable to choose the state engine
		 export LIXA_STATE_ENGINE=TRADITIONAL
		 for the traditional state engine (default),
		 export LIXA_STATE_ENGINE=JOURNAL
		 for the new journal based state engine.
		 New capabilities of the state engine:
		 - RPO=0 in the event of lixad crash, for any reason, but
		   Linux operating system survival (this new behaviour 
		   eliminate most of the un-necessary rollback/commit during
		   the recovery phase and
		   requested by the traditional state server to the 
		   applications due to the lack of the last data)
		 - 2 order of magnitude smaller latency in comparison with the
		   traditional state engine
2019-05-12 1.7.8 Added (client) connection timeout; default value = 5000 ms
		 A new error message (LXC034E) is sent to the syslog in the
		 event that the client doesn't get a reply before timeout
		 expiration. The previous behaviour can be obtained setting a
		 new environment variable:
		 export LIXA_CLIENT_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=-1
		 A shorter timeout can be set as well:
		 export LIXA_CLIENT_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=1000
		 In the event of timeout, the socket is immediately closed and
		 it can't re-used to guarantee consistency.
		 New getConnectionTimeout() and setConnectionTimeout() methods.
		 XID serialization for PostgreSQL has been changed from native
		 LIXA (formatID.Hex(gtrid).Hex(bqual)) to the same used by
		 PostgreSQL's JDBC driver (formatID_Base64(gtrid)_Base64(bqual))
		 Fixed some errors in return codes of MySQL and PostgreSQL
		 LIXA adapters.
		 Implemented a workaround to mitigate a MySQL bug that LIXA
		 exploited during autorecovery of prepared transactions
		 https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=87836
		 Introduced method TransactionManager.delete() in XTA for Java
		 to force TCP/IP socket close before Java garbage collection
		 execution.
		 Fixed a bug in XTA: the client TCP connection was not
		 explicitly closed by xta_transaction_delete.

2019-04-07 1.7.7 Documentation fix

2019-03-22 1.7.6 Fixed a bug related to xta_transaction_start() issued multiple
		 times on an object used for multiple branches transaction.
		 Fixed a bug related to XTA multiple branches pseudo synchronous
		 pattern when the subordinate gets an error during "prepare".
		 Fixed a bug related LIXA_XAER_HAZARD: this is a strange
		 condition for XA standard, but it's exploited by an old
		 JDBC driver for PostgreSQL.
		 *** WARNING: ***
		 This release is *NOT* compatible with previous ones: you can't
		 mix 1.7.6 and previous versions in the same environment
		 (message LXC030E will be logged in the event of level
		 mismatch); LIXA_MSG_LEVEL=4.

2019-02-23 1.7.5 Docker images for LIXA (XTA for Java)
		 Fixed a build bug related to tests/src/java directory

2019-02-09 1.7.4 Docker image for LIXA client (command line utilities)
		 Added environment variable LIXA_STATE_SERVERS

2019-02-03 1.7.3 Docker image for LIXA state server: lixad
		 New build options, dedicated to disable single components and
		 syslog: they are useful to produce Docker images.
		 --disable-syslog build option can be used to have messages on
		 stderr instead of sending them to system logger.

2019-01-20 1.7.2 Java API for XTA
		 These functions/methods are now deprecated because useless:
		 - xta_transaction_open
		 - xta_transaction_close
		 they will be removed in the near future.
		 Renamed to lowercase C++ API methods
		 	Removed xta::Transaction.Open
		 	Removed xta::Transaction.Close
		 Renamed to lowercase Python API methods
		 	Removed Transaction.Open
		 	Removed Transaction.Close
		 *** WARNING: ***
		 This release breaks compatibility with previous versions of
		 C++ and Python XTA API: the first char of the method names
		 must be changed from Uppercase to lowercase
		 *** WARNING: ***
		 This release is *NOT* compatible with previous ones: you can't
		 mix 1.7.2 and previous versions in the same environment
		 (message LXC030E will be logged in the event of level
		 mismatch); LIXA_MSG_LEVEL=3.
		 *** NOTE: ***
		 This release uses function get_native_connection() instead of
		 _get_native_connection() as it's provided by psycopg2 2.8
		 (next release, already in git master tree)

2018-10-28 1.7.1 Python API for XTA
		 Both Python 2 and Python 3 can be used with XTA for Python.
		 Examples in doc/examples/xta/python tested with:
		 - Ubuntu 14.04
		   - MySQL      5.5.61
		   - PostgreSQL 9.3.24
		   - Python2    2.7.6
		   - Python3    3.4.3
		 - RHEL 7.5
		   - MariaDB    5.5.60
		   - PostgreSQL 9.2.4
		   - Python2    2.7.5

2018-09-17 1.7.0 C++ API for XTA

2018-05-27 1.6.0 First stable official version of XTA XA Transaction API
		 This release is *NOT* compatible with previous ones: you can't
		 mix 1.6.0 and previous versions in the same environment
		 (message LXC030E will be logged in the event of level
		 mismatch); LIXA_MSG_LEVEL=2.
		 Fixed a bug related to XTA, multiple applications, concurrent
		 branches in the event of state server crash during two phase
		 commit.
		 Removed persistency synchronization after xa_start: this
		 optimization halves the number of syncs and probably reduces
		 the latency introduced by LIXA.i
		 *** WARNING: *** in the event of transactional inconsistencies
		 please open an issue on GitHub
		 https://github.com/tiian/lixa/issues

20180413 - 1.5.3 XTA documentation: a dedicated chapter has been added in the
		 official LIXA manual

20180304 - 1.5.2 XTA support for concurrent branches
		 This release is *NOT* compatible with previous ones: you can't
		 mix 1.5.2 and previous versions in the same environment
		 (message LXC030E will be logged in the event of level
		 mismatch)

20171010 - 1.5.1 XTA support for "Suspend/Resume" pattern

20170921 - 1.5.0 Release of XTA API (XA Transaction API)

                 code (currently located in directories src/client, 
		 src/common, src/xta) will change to LGPL 2.1.

20170318 - 1.3.4 LIXA Very Stupid Robot (lixavsr) additional use cases:

		*** Dropped support for old glib2 versions: ***
		minimum version is now 2.32 (don't upgrade to this LIXA version
		if you are running a glib2 version that's older than 2.32).
		Alternatively, you can install your own copy of glib2 from
		sources.
		These Linux versions are no more tested:
		- Ubuntu 10.04
		- CentOS 6.x
		because they provide a default version for glib2 that's below
		2.32

20170124 - 1.3.1 added more non-standard tx_ interfaces for suspending and
                 resuming global transactions

20161117 - 1.3.0 made interface changes to allow clients to join an existing
		global transaction exposed internal lixa_tx methods to work
		with XID on the tx_ interface implemented test cases XID/2.0

                 value (-1) of NULL XID and mixed 32/64 bit environments
                 (ffffffff is not equal to -1 for a x86-64 Linux)

20120103 - 0.7.0 First beta release

20111128 - 0.5.35 Intel/AMD 64 bit architecture passed test phase

20111113 - 0.5.34 a switch file for MySQL is now available
                  the package supplies some examples that show how LIXA can
                  be used in conjunction with MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and
                  DB2 performing DTP

20110927 - 0.5.33 library liblixabmt was renamed to liblixab
                  library liblixacmt was renamed to liblixac
                  a switch file for PostgreSQL is now available
                  the package supplies some examples that show how LIXA can
                  be used in conjunction with PostgreSQL, Oracle and DB2
                  performing distributed transaction processing

20110504 - 0.5.32 the package supplies an example that shows how LIXA can
                  be used in conjunction with Oracle Database Server and IBM
                  DB2, performing a real distributed transaction

20110426 - 0.5.31 the package supplies an example that shows how LIXA can
                  be used in conjunction with IBM DB2

20110419 - 0.5.30 the package supplies an example that shows how LIXA can
                  be used in conjunction with Oracle Database Server

20110401 - 0.5.29 "make install" installs the HTML version of the manual in
                  the standard doc directory
                  "make dist" injects the HTML version of the manual in the

                  in the lixac_conf.xml file; the previous name was 
                  misleading because the LIXA server is not a transaction
                  manager but it only persists the state of the transaction
                  managers (embedded in liblixac)

20110130 - 0.5.27 fixed bug # 3166737
                  NOTE: the client/server communication protocol was changed:
