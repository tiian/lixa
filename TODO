TX/3.3/2.0 it seems the real return code of ax_unreg is not sent to the server

Protect TX from TX_FAIL: if it happens, no function can be called after it

Stability test with valgrind must be performed

Stress test must be performed

Crash test must be performed

Remove all @@@ from source code: every one was/is an "open point"
