Check again the fix for ax_reg (the message is sent only if TM_OK is the
current return code...); compare with ax_unreg. Probably a finer idea must be
found: when the message must be sent to the server? Think it and fix the
software accordingly....

Develop XA driven specification case tests (xa_5_26.at)
- xa_open/xa_close: test xa_info (255 chars + NULL)
- tests all possible return codes for every function and an invalid one too

Stability test with valgrind must be performed

Stress test must be performed

Crash test must be performed

Remove all @@@ from source code: every one was/is an "open point"
