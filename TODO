go on with lixa_xa_open
IT SEEMS THERE'S A MEMORY LEAK ON THE CLIENT SIDE... inspect the behaviour
implement tx_open and xa_open...: see *** server_xa_open_1 *** function!

Memory leaks seem to be inside client_status_coll_add 
and
array of actual resource managers

There's a freeze bug if the client is launched with LIXA_TRACE_MASK=0x0 (the
bug happens only the first time)


When server_manager_thread exits, the listener must be aware of this...
