tx_commit development; restart from lixa_tx_commit: 
    analyze csr->xa_s_state of all the resource manager:
      are all in state S3 (prepared?) go on with normal two phase commit
      are there only one in state S2 (idle?) go on with one phase commit

tx_prepare: if there is only one resource manager, skip prepare (we should 
move to commit/rollback without prepare)


When server_manager_thread exits, the listener must be aware of this... 

Implement a "test resource manager" can be driven by "open string" with the
return code of every XA function. This would become the reference tool for
testing and debugging:
1. experiment a defect
2. activate the trace
3. pick-up the return code of every resource manager
4. reproduce the behavior with any "test resource manager"
