for some strange (!) reason, xa_prepare returns XA_RDONLY with Oracle XE...
and data are not committed inside the table
... this must be investigated...
These was already tryed :(
- privileges:
  grant select on dba_pending_transactions to hr
  it's documented and necessary, but it does not solve the issue
- removing tables creation before INSERT transaction: it does not solve the    
  issue

The problem must be investigated deeply and deeply... 



When server_manager_thread exits, the listener must be aware of this... 

Implement a "test resource manager" can be driven by "open string" with the
return code of every XA function. This would become the reference tool for
testing and debugging:
1. experiment a defect
2. activate the trace
3. pick-up the return code of every resource manager
4. reproduce the behavior with any "test resource manager"
