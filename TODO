When server_manager_thread exits, the listener must be aware of this... 

Print the features (debug, trace, crash) has been compiled in the software and
the version (main version, library version) on syslog and/or command line for
lixad

Implement a "test resource manager" can be driven by "open string" with the
return code of every XA function. This would become the reference tool for
testing and debugging:
1. experiment a defect
2. activate the trace
3. pick-up the return code of every resource manager
4. reproduce the behavior with any "test resource manager"
The same source should be compiled 3 times to produce 3 different resource
managers and avoid pesky matters related to static variables.

Remove all @@@ from source code: every one was/is an "open point"
