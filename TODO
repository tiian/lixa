lixa_job_set_path_profile...

transform "profile" to "job" in open_8 because profile is useless on server
side and is not stored in the server status

store MD5 lixac_conf.xml digest on server; when recovery happens
check the digests; on server side only warning; on client side, stop 
processing if digests do no match (Request for Enhancement: reload config
from server, recovery, discard config read from server, use config on file,
go on with new transactions...)

When server_manager_thread exits, the listener must be aware of this... 

Implement a "test resource manager" can be driven by "open string" with the
return code of every XA function. This would become the reference tool for
testing and debugging:
1. experiment a defect
2. activate the trace
3. pick-up the return code of every resource manager
4. reproduce the behavior with any "test resource manager"
The same source should be compiled 3 times to produce 3 different resource
managers and avoid pesky matters related to static variables.

Remove all @@@ from source code: every one was/is an "open point"
