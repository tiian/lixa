LIXA Monkey RM implementation in progress:
- load a file (xa_open) with all the step/return codes
- implement the monkey (!)
- implement "call_ax_reg" and "call_ax_unreg" too to emulate a dynamic 
registration

When server_manager_thread exits, the listener must be aware of this... 

Remove "ltdl" if it is unused (I suppose it...)

Remove all @@@ from source code: every one was/is an "open point"
