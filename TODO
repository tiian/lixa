Restart from xa_5_52.at test case...

Develop XA driven specification case tests
- tests all possible return codes for every function and an invalid one too

Understand this sentence (XA pag. 52):
The first argument, xid, is a pointer to the XID that a resource manager must associate
with the calling thread of control. The transaction manager guarantees the XID to be
unique for different transaction branches. The transaction manager may generate a
new branch qualifier within the XID when it calls xa_start() for a new thread of control
association (that is, when TMRESUME is not set in flags; see TMRESUME below). If
the transaction manager elects to reuse a branch qualifier previously given to the
resource manager for the XID, the transaction manager must inform the resource
manager that it is doing so (by setting TMJOIN in flags; see TMJOIN below).


This could be related to a multithread application: can I create a multithread
application using TX and with parallel branches? How can I distinguish this
situation from indipendent threads?


Stability test with valgrind must be performed

Stress test must be performed

Crash test must be performed

Remove all @@@ from source code: every one was/is an "open point"
