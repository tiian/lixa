continue case test development for recovery failed transactions (see   
lixad_clean_failded.at)

implement a command line for lixad to reset "recovery failed" bits at start-up

this will be the sequence to clean recovery failed records:
- start lixad in maintenance mode
- execute lixar and clean all the transactions
- use lixad to dump the status file
- check the recovery failed records has been committed/rolled back by lixar
- restart lixad using clean up flags

go on with bug 2983464 fixing...

Remove all @@@ from source code: every one was/is an "open point"
