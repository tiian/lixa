lixa_common_status.h: change xa_t_state to xa_td_state to reflect static and
dynamic association

When server_manager_thread exits, the listener must be aware of this... 

Implement a "test resource manager" can be driven by "open string" with the
return code of every XA function. This would become the reference tool for
testing and debugging:
1. experiment a defect
2. activate the trace
3. pick-up the return code of every resource manager
4. reproduce the behavior with any "test resource manager"
The same source should be compiled 3 times to produce 3 different resource
managers and avoid pesky matters related to static variables.

Remove all @@@ from source code: every one was/is an "open point"
