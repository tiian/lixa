Test case TX/B.5/8.6 shows an issue in lixa_tx_rc_add; a problem is related
to XAER_NOTA with a different outcome from one resource manager and many
resource managers. It might be a solution to rewrite the function and
use a different approach calculating tx_rc from scratch at every insertion
instead of using an incremental approach..... Thinking about it....

Protect TX from TX_FAIL: if it happens, no function can be called after it

Stability test with valgrind must be performed

Stress test must be performed

Crash test must be performed

Remove all @@@ from source code: every one was/is an "open point"
