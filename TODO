Change lixa_xa.c row 1458: do not propagate XA_HEURHAZ, but a custom value
LIXA_HAZARD defined in lixa_tx_rc.h
After this change, all the test cases must be passed before xa_5_49.at row
577 can be modified to reproduce the bug.

Develop XA driven specification case tests
- tests all possible return codes for every function and an invalid one too

Stability test with valgrind must be performed

Stress test must be performed

Crash test must be performed

Remove all @@@ from source code: every one was/is an "open point"
